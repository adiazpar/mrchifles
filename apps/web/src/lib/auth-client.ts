// We wrap the factory call in a function so the inferred return type is

// declaration. Without the wrapper, `export const authClient = ...` emits
// TS2742 under `composite: true` because the inferred shape names that
// internal module path, which isn't portable across `.d.ts` emit. A naive
// `ReturnType<typeof createAuthClient>` annotation collapses the generic
// to an empty-plugin form, which strips the typings for our
// additionalFields (`language`, `phoneNumber`, …) on `updateUser` and
// `session.user`, so we deliberately keep the wrapper pattern instead.
